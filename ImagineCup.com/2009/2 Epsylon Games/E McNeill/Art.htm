<H2>Art</H2>
<P>To start with, <I>I am not an artist.</I> But I did take a class on Digital 
Arts, and I had a lot of fun, so I figured I would share my creations. All of 
the following were created in Maya. 
<P>First, the biped. This was our final project in 3D Digital Modeling. He's 
some sort of cyber ninja. I don't really know. But I like him! 
<P>I also made a 10-second animation, which was really very rewarding. <A

<P>This spider was made using subdivision surfaces. He was rigged, but never 
animated, and never textured.

<P>This room was my first ever project in 3D Modeling. It's designed to be the 
ultimate sunroom. Note that the far wall is just one big mirror (most of the 
objects in the first image are reflections). Alas, the fancy lighting that I set 
up for this scene bugged out on me at the last minute, but I'm still satisfied 
with the result.
