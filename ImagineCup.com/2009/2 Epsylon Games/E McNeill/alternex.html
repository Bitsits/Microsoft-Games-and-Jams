</p><p>Alternex is a "hardcore educational" game about alternative energy strategies. It won 2nd place in the 2009 <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/">Imagine Cup</a> Game Development competition. <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ee11/imaginecup.html">More about that.</a>

</p><p>In Alternex, players must minimize the amount of waste produced
by a nation's power plants over a given time by researching new
technologies and building more efficient power plants. The nation's
power needs grow at a fast clip, and players must manage resources
wisely if they hope to keep up.

<p>Implementing alternative energy strategies is a complex task that is
full of unique hurdles, several of which show up in Alternex. For
example:
</p><p>Some alternative energy collection can only take place on
certain terrain, and altering the power grid to account for the extra
distance from population centers can be expensive.
</p><p>Since it's never clear what a technology will look like after
years of intense research, it is often useful to research several
technologies at the same time, even if only one will eventually be
implemented on a grand scale.
</p><p>Technological improvement never stops, but power plants must be
built. It's up to the player to determine when a technology is mature
enough for an early implementation. Waiting can allow it to become
cheaper and more efficient, but waiting too long lets waste pile up in
the meantime. <br></p><h2><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ee11/AlternexSS2.png"><img src="alternex_files/AlternexSS2small.gif"></a></h2>

<p>Alternex does not shove its educational points in the player's face.
Instead, it models the complex systems behind energy reform and lets
the lessons emerge through play.
