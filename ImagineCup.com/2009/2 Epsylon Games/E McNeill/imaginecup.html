<br>
<br> 
</p><p>In July 2009 I attended the World Finals of Microsoft's Imagine
Cup competition in the game development category. My game, Alternex,
won second place.
</p><p>It was pretty incredible to get flown to Cairo and get to hang
out in a foreign city with a multinational crowd of genius tech/art
people. It's probably the coolest thing that's ever happened to me in
my pre-professional life.
</p><p>One of Microsoft's bloggers at the event did a series of posts following me through the competition. <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ee11/ImagineCupStory.pdf">That story</a> was published during the competition on the Imagine Cup blog and talks all about the details of the event. 

</p><p>I also got a swanky <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Enews/releases/2009/07/17.html">news release</a> from my college and <a href="http://thedartmouth.com/2009/07/10/news/McNeill">a story in the student newspaper, The Dartmouth</a>.

</p><p>And here are some pictures of me hard at work at the event:
